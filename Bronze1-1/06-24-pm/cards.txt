
Given N (3 <= N <= 100) cards where each card has an upper case letter (A-Z) followed by an integer (between 1 and 100). If Bessie picks three cards randomly (without replacement), what is the probability that any card shares a letter or an integer with at least one of the other cards? Express the probability in simplified fraction and display the numerator and denominator separated by a white space.

Input (from terminal / stdin)
The first line contains integer N.
Each of the next N lines have a String with an upper case letter followed by an integer.

No two cards are the same.

Output (to terminal / stdout)
Report the probability that any card shares a letter or an integer with at least one of the other cards, if three cards are picked up randomly. Display the numerator and denominator (simplified) separated by a white space.

Sample input
5
A2
A3
B2
B3
C100

Sample output
2 5

There are four combinations to pick three cards satisfying the requirement:

A2, A3, B2
A2, A3, B3
A2, B2, B3
A3, B2, B3

There are total 10 combinations. So the probability is 4/10 = 2/5. So the output is "2 5".
