
Given n strings consisting of letters 'C', 'O', 'W', each having length L, display the K-th smallest string of length L that also has only letters 'C', 'O', or 'W', but is different from any of the n given strings. The strings are compared using the dictionary order.

Input (from terminal / stdin)
The first line contains integer n (n <= 100), integer L (L<=15), and integer K (K<=10^6).
Each of the next n lines contain a string consisting of letters 'C', 'O', 'W'.

Output (to terminal / stdout)
Display the K-th smallest string consisting 'C', 'O', 'W' that is different from any of the n given strings.

Sample input
3 4 4
COWO
COWW
CWOO

Sample output
CCOC

The first four strings not from the input are:
CCCC
CCCO
CCCW
CCOC
